    <h1>Exercise 1.1</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Your task is to write a Star class that you will then use to create falling and shooting star 
                animations.
            </p>
            <p>Open <code>sketch.js</code>. You will see that it contains a function, <code>star()</code>, that draws a star 
            at x and y coordinates provided as function arguments. You may recognise this function from an earlier practical. It is provided to help you implement the Star class. It will 
            not be used in the finished sketch.</p>
            <p>At the top of the file, create a class called <code>Star</code>. It should have two instance variables, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, that are 
            initialised with values passed to the constructor. For example, to create a star at 100, 300, you would type:</p>
            <pre>let myStar = new Star(100, 300);</pre>
            <p>Next, add a method called <code>draw()</code>. This method should have no parameters. It should draw the star at the object's 
            x and y coordinates. So, to draw the example star created above, you could type:</p>
            <pre>myStar.draw();</pre>
            <p>...and a star would appear at 100, 300.</p>
            <p>Next, add two more methods, one called <code>fall()</code> and one called <code>shoot()</code>. Both methods should take 
            one parameter called <code>speed</code>, a number representing the number of pixels the star should fall or shoot by respectively.</p>
            <p>Implement the methods. <code>fall()</code> should move the star object along the y axis and <code>shoot()</code> should move the star 
            object along the x axis. Here are examples of how the methods would be called on the example star object:</p>
            <pre>myStar.fall(2); // moves the star two pixels down the y axis
myStar.shoot(5); // moves the star five pixels along the x axis.
            </pre>
            <p>Outside the class, create an animation to test your methods. For example, the animation shown in the video below was created as follows (<code>Star</code> 
            class not shown):</p>
            <pre>let fallingStar = new Star(200, 0);
let shootingStar = new Star(0, 200);
                
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}
                
function draw() {
  background(0);
  shootingStar.shoot(5);
  shootingStar.draw();
  fallingStar.fall(2);
  fallingStar.draw();
}</pre>

                    <p>You will find it helpful to have the bouncingBallsOO example from lecture open to use as reference. You can find all example code in the <a href="https://github.com/UoY-PDM1/PDM1-example-code" target="_blank">PDM1-example-code repo</a>.</p>
                    <p>The main thing to remember (that people often forget), is that when referencing instance variables from within 
                        the class, you need to type <code>this.</code> before the variable name. You can see lots of examples of this in 
                        the bouncingBallsOO example code.
                    </p>
                    <p>Creating a method is exactly like creating a function, it just needs to be <em>inside</em> the class definition--that means 
                    completely between the opening and closing curly braces. You also should leave out the keyword <code>function</code>. There are 
                    examples in the bouncingBalls00 sketch.</p>
                    <p>To implement the <code>draw()</code> method, copy and paste the contents of the <code>star()</code> 
                    function into your <code>draw()</code> method (not the <code>draw()</code> <em>function</em>) and 
                    replace the uses of the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arguments in the original to use the the instance variables 
                    instead.</p>
                    <p>Implementing the <code>fall()</code> and <code>move()</code> methods should be straightforward. 
                    We didn't go over an example of a method with a parameter in class but the syntax is exactly the same 
                    as parameters in functions and the class constructor.</p>
