    <h1>Exercise 1.2</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>
    <div class="guidance">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Write a class called <code>Coordinate</code> that has two properties, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, which are initialised by 
            arguments passed to the constructor. Here is an example of the class being used:</p>
            <pre>let coordinate = new Coordinate(175, 350);
console.log(coordinate.x); // prints 175
console.log(coordinate.y); // prints 350
            </pre>
            <p>Add a method called <code>isInBounds()</code> that will check if the coordinate is inside a given bounding box (e.g. the canvas, or a rectangle). 
            The method should take four parameters representing: (1) the top left x coordinate of the bounding box, (2) the top left y coordinate 
            of the bounding box, (3) the width of the bounding box, and (4) the height of the bounding box. The method should return true if the coordinate 
            is inside the box, and false otherwise. Here's an example:</p>
            <pre>console.log(coordinate.isInBounds(100, 100, 400, 300)); // prints true
console.log(coordinate.isInBounds(0, 0, 200, 100)); // prints false
            </pre>
            <p>Test your class and method by creating the output shown below. When the mouse is clicked inside 
                the canvas, a random ellipse is drawn on screen. When the mouse is clicked outside the canvas, nothing 
                happens. Use your <code>Coordinate</code> class and the <code>isInBounds()</code> method to 
                figure out if an ellipse should be drawn.
            </p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>
            <p>

                    <p>You will find it helpful to have the bouncingBallsOO example from lecture open to use as reference.</p>
                    <p>The main thing to remember (that people often forget), is that when referencing instance variables from within 
                        the class, you need to type <code>this.</code> before the variable name. You can see lots of examples of this in 
                        the bouncingBallsOO example code.
                    </p>
                    <p>Creating a method is exactly like creating a function, it just needs to be <em>inside</em> the class definition--that means 
                    completely between the opening and closing curly braces. You also should leave out the keyword <code>function</code>. There are 
                    examples in the bouncingBalls00 sketch.</p>
                    <p>Implementing the <code>isInBounds()</code> method should be straightforward as there are examples of exactly 
                        the same functionality in earlier lecture examples and practical exercise solutions. 
                    We didn't go over an example of a method that returns in class but the syntax is exactly the same 
                    as functions that return.</p>
