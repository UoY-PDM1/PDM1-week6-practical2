    <h1>Exercise 1.3</h1>
    <p>Your sketch:</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Classes are really useful for creating UI controls (e.g. buttons, checkboxes, input fields). UI 
                controls all have locations and dimensions as well as other properties specific to the type of 
                control. For example, buttons will generally have labels, the text that is displayed on the button. 
                UI controls also typically need to track their <em>state</em> e.g. clicked or not clicked, selected or not 
                selected.
            </p>
            <p>In sketch.js, you will find an outline of a <code>Button</code> class that will be used to create 
            a clickable button on the canvas. Your first task is to finish implementing the class. You will need to 
            add instance variables to store the values of the arguments passed to the constructor. The constructor and 
            all methods have been documented--use this information to implement the constructor and methods.</p>
            <p>Notice that the <code>#mouseIsOver()</code> method begins with the # symbol. In a JavaScript class, any
                instance variable or method that begins with # is <em>private</em>, meaning it can't be accessed outside 
                of the class. Private variables and methods can be used to restrict access to data and behaviour that 
                calling code doesn't need to use. A core principle of object-oriented programming is "information hiding", 
                meaning that the implementation details of an object should generally be hidden from the code that uses 
                the object. Hiding information reduces the risk of bugs caused by calling code changing the values of 
                instance variables or the object's state. Consider whether your instance variables should be private or 
                public. There is no right answer here... it is your design choice to make.
            </p>
            <p>Any details of how the button is displayed that are not specified (e.g. label alignment) in the method 
                documentation are up to you.
            </p>
            <p>When the Button class is complete, your next task is to use it to approximate the output shown below. Your sketch should:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Draw a Button labelled "Click me!" on the canvas at your preferred location and size.</li>
                <li>Increment a global variable called <code>counter</code> every time the button is clicked.</li>
                <li>Display the number of times the button has been clicked.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Check your work by running <a href="./check-exercise1-3.html">check-exercise1-3.html</a>.</p>
            <p>Expected output:</p>

                    <h3>Implementing the Button class</h3>
                    <p>Start by implementing the Button instance variables. You will need one variable for each constructor argument. If you 
                        would like to make the instance variables private, use # before the name e.g. #x, #y. In the constructor, assign the values 
                        of the arguments to the instance variables. Private instance variables should be preceded with <code>this.</code> just like 
                        any other class member.
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, implement the private method, <code>#isMouseOver()</code>. This method should check if <code>mouseX</code> and 
                    <code>mouseY</code> are within the bounds of the Button. You have seen many examples of this type of 
                    check now so no further hints are provided.</p>
                    <p>Next, implement the <code>clicked()</code> method. This method should check if the mouse is over the the button and 
                    if the mouse is currently pressed. Make use of the <code>#mouseIsOver()</code> method you have already written. There is 
                    a system variable that tells you if the mouse is currently pressed... you used it earlier in 
                    the semester. Take a look at the p5.js reference if you can't remember what the variable is.</p>
                    <p>Finally, implement the <code>draw()</code> method. You can choose the text size and alignment. Use your <code>#mouseIsOver()</code> method to determine if 
                    the button is hovered. If it is set the button's fill using <code>fill(0, 0, 255);</code>. Otherwise, the button's fill should be 
                    black. You will need to call <code>fill()</code> again before drawing the label text on the button, otherwise the text will be the same 
                    colour as the button and you won't be able to see it.</p>
                    <h3>Using the Button class to create the expected output</h3>
                    <p>You will need two global variables: one to store an instance of the <code>Button</code> class and another called <code>counter</code>, 
                    which should be set to 0 initially. When you create the <code>Button</code> object, you can choose the location and 
                    dimensions but the label should be "Click me!".</p>
                    <p>In the <code>draw()</code> function, call the button's <code>draw()</code> method. Check that it shows up on screen and test the hover 
                    effect.</p>
                    <p>To click the button, implement the <code>mousePressed()</code> function. Why not <code>mouseClicked()</code>? Your implementation of the 
                    button's <code>clicked()</code> method should be making use of the <code>mouseIsPressed</code> system variable. As this is only true when the mouse 
                    is actively held down, not after it is clicked, <code>mousePressed()</code> is the appropriate function to use. Inside <code>mousePressed()</code> call 
                    the button's <code>clicked()</code> method. If the button is clicked, add one to the <code>counter</code> variable.</p>
                    <p>Finally, display text that uses <code>counter</code> to show how many times the button has been clicked.</p>
